	This website presents the contents of the course "Learning Adaptive and Reactive Control for Robots" created by Prof. Aude Billard at EPFL.
	The course focuses on the use of dynamical systems to create reactive control schemes for robotic systems. Whilst based on the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046169/" style="color: blue;">Book MIT Press</a> of the same name, 
	the course was adapted to the 13-weeks semester format, with 4h of lessons each week.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The work showcased here is continuously updated with advances in research conducted at LASA in the relevant fields.

	This book presents a wealth of machine learning techniques to make the control of robots more flexible and safe when interacting with humans. It introduces a set of control laws that enable reactivity using dynamical systems, a widely used method for solving motion-planning problems in robotics. These control approaches can re-plan in milliseconds to adapt to new environmental constraints and offer safe and compliant control of forces in contact. The techniques offer theoretical advantages, including convergence to a goal, non-penetration of obstacles, and passivity. The coverage of learning begins with low-level control parameters and progresses to higher-level competencies composed of combinations of skills.

	The book is meant to be used as Textbook for graduate-level courses in robotics, and, hence, the chapters proceed from fundamentals to more advanced content. The first section presents an overview of the techniques introduced, including learning from demonstration, optimization, and reinforcement learning. Subsequent sections present the core techniques for learning control laws with dynamical systems, trajectory planning with dynamical systems, and methods for compliant and force control using dynamical systems.

Each chapter describes applications, which range from arm manipulators to whole-body control of humanoid robots, and offers both pencil-and-paper and programming exercises.

Lecture videos, slides, handwritten and programming exercises instructions and MATLAB code for the exercises are available in the table below.
